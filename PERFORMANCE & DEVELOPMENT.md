## PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

A performance review is held once a year with every team member to determine whether they are meeting expectations or not. Compensation adjustments are also discussed if pertinent.

## TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

At MADVISION we aim to make everyone better than when they arrived. For this reason we allocate a budget for continuous learning & education.
