# Getting Started

## Expectations
Getting started at Madvision can be overwhelming. There are a lot of little details, multiple projects to work on, but we are here to help. Your manager will set up an internal project dedicated to your onboarding. When you start, you’ll have access to that project. In it, you’ll see to-dos linking to accounts or services that you need to set up, amongst other things.

If you have a specific training schedule or training milestones to complete, that will go into that project as well.

Depending on the situation & your level of experience, you may have to prioritize current projects over the onboarding tasks.
